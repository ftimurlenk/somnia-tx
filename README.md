# Sequential Contract Interaction Tool for Somnia âœ¨

This is a web application designed to sequentially interact with a predefined list of smart contracts on a specified blockchain network. It allows a user to connect their wallet and automatically execute transactions with all contracts in the list by clicking a single button.

This tool is particularly useful for scenarios that require generating on-chain activity on testnets, preparing for airdrop events, or any use case that involves regular interaction with a specific list of contracts.
